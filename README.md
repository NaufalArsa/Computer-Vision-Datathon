# üöÄ Datathon APD: YOLOv8 Computer Vision Project

Welcome to the **Datathon APD YOLOv8** project! This repository contains our solution for the [Datathon APD] challenge, leveraging the power of YOLOv8 for advanced object detection and computer vision tasks.

## üìù Project Description
This project aims to tackle real-world computer vision problems using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model. Our approach focuses on accurate, fast, and robust object detection, tailored for the unique requirements of the datathon.

## ‚ú® Features
- ‚ö° **YOLOv8 Integration**: Cutting-edge object detection architecture
- üìä **Custom Dataset Support**: Easily adapt to new datasets
- üèÜ **Competition-Ready**: Optimized for datathon performance
- üìà **Visualization Tools**: See predictions and results visually
- üõ†Ô∏è **Easy to Use**: Jupyter Notebook workflow for rapid prototyping

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- Other dependencies (see notebook for details)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computer-vision.git
   cd computer-vision
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -U ultralytics jupyter
   # Add any other required packages here
   ```

## üìö Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook datathon_apd_yolov8.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the notebook cells to:
   - Load and preprocess your dataset
   - Train or fine-tune the YOLOv8 model
   - Evaluate and visualize results

## üñºÔ∏è Results
- Example predictions and performance metrics will be displayed in the notebook.
- Add your best results, screenshots, or leaderboard scores here!
